# Migration Report

## Files Moved
- `gallery.html` → `pages/gallery/index.html`
- JS modules → `js/modules/`

## New Structure Created
- `/pages/` - All sub-pages
- `/components/` - Reusable HTML components
- `/js/core/` - Core functionality
- `/js/modules/` - Feature modules

## Next Steps
1. Update all internal links in moved files
2. Extract header/footer into components
3. Implement component loader
4. Update navigation paths
5. Test all functionality

## Important Notes
- All image and asset paths need to be updated to be relative
- Navigation.js needs updates for new paths
- Consider implementing path resolution utility
